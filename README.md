HOME Binary folder
==================

This repo is my custom scripts housed in my $HOME/bin folder, and included
in the PATH of my Shell.

## Non-Script contents
These are placed in $HOME/bin/non-scripts/ and are blocked from Git commits via .gitignore

You should then write a simple wrapper script which invokes the related binary with all arguments
provided by the initial command-line.
